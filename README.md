# NYC Citi Bike Data Analysis

## Purpose
New York's popular on-demand bike rental service, Citi Bike, has the potential to serve as a great model for similar projects in smaller cities.
In order to examine the potential for a successful bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa, we first needed to analyze the successful Citi Bike program in New York.
This data analysis set serves to dig deeper into the specifics of Citi Bike's NYC operations. Our end goal is to discover better ways to build, market, and maintain a similar service for a much smaller population in Des Moines.

## Tools
Using Tableau, I created a variety of visualizations to show the typical user experience on a New York Citi Bike. These visualizations use data from Citi Bike from the month of August 2019. 
August is a popular month for tourism to New York, so this data shows us the Citi Bike service at its most popular. 

## Results

I began the analysis with the big picture.
* There were 2,344,224 individual trips on Citi Bikes in New York City in August of 2019. 
* 13,983 unique citi bikes were used during the month. 
  * This is approximately 1 bike for every 600 citizens. 
  * With Des Moines's current population of 215,636 people, the project could expect to need around 360 bikes.

Next, I examined Citi Bike's day user-to-subscriber ratio. The vast majority of Citi Bike users subscribe to the service, meaning they intend to use it regularly.
* This is great news for a startup company. This means that we could successfully market a Des Moines bike share service as part of your monthly transportation budget, and not a one-time event.

After looking at the big numbers, I wanted to analyze a typical Citi Bike trip. 
* For NYC users, the most popular place to begin your bike trip is also the most popular place to visit -- Lower Manhattan.
* For a bike share company in Des Moines, we may need extra stations in popular places like the Pappajohn Sculpture Park or Gray's Lake Park.
* The most popular time to ride the Citi Bikes in NYC is between 5 PM - 7 PM. 
  * People may be using the citi bikes for their work commute. This is a great piece of information for us to know as we plan to market a bike sharing service in another city.
* The most popular day of the week to ride the Citi Bikes in NYC is Thursday. However, the weekends see more consistent numbers throughout the day.
  * When setting up the Des Moines service, we could connect with local breweries or restaurants to popularize "biking to work and biking to happy hour" on Thursday evenings. 
* Throughout the data, we see that the service is more popular with customers who identify as male. These customers are more likely to use the service, and use it on a more consistent basis. 
  * This poses a question for the Des Moines startup: do we continue to market primarily to male customers? Or do we find a way to balance those demographics in our area?
* We found that the majority of Citi Bike users in NYC ride for approximately 5-20 minutes. 
  * As Des Moines is a less walkable city than New York -- will these numbers change drastically for users in a less-condensed city? Could that increase a need for bike maintenance?
* Citi Bike users in NYC are ending their trips not far from where they started. 
  * Again, this shows that the bike sharing program in Des Moines could be promoted as a way to travel between restaurants, bars, breweries, and music spots within neighborhoods.

## Summary
The data shows that New Yorkers ride their Citi Bikes with consistency. Customers of all genders ride the bikes throughout the week and for the majority of the day. This shows that a bike sharing service is not just for tourists.
Seeing regular usage of the bikes shows that the bikes are being used as a replacement form of transportation, which is excellent news for any city looking to emulate the success of Citi Bike in a city with less tourism. 

However, there are concerns with translating this data to a smaller city like Des Moines. The next steps would be to examine: 
* The number of major roads in Des Moines with designated bike lanes or clear sidewalks. 
* The Des Moines neighborhoods in which customers might be able to travel between locations in less than 20 minutes.
* The bike maintenance required, including the times of day in which bike maintenance could be performed
